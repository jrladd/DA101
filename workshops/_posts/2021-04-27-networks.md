### Six Degrees of Francis Bacon and Network Analysis

Begin by reading this post on Scott Weingart's blog that introduces the concept of networks: <http://scottbot.net/lets-talk-about-networks/>.

Go to [sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com](http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/). Search for the individual network of ONE of these five people: Ben Jonson (1572-1637), Lucy Russell (1581-1627), Margaret Cavendish (1623-73), and John Milton (1608-74). As you navigate through the network (remember the basics of site navigation that we covered last class), complete the following exercise:

Exercise 1:

- Click on some of the other nodes (circles) and edges (lines) to see the other people in your central person's network. How did they know the central person? What do these relationships tell you about the central person? (Hint: the concentric view may be helpful for this.)

- What are the main groups that people in your person's network are members of? What might this tell us about your person?

Exercise 2:

- Open the filter panel on the right-hand side (the icon looks like a funnel).

- Decrease the time-range slider to five years and drag it throughout the person's lifetime. Who appears as your person gets older? Who disappears?

- Change the confidence level range to only 80% and up. Are there relationships that we feel more confident about and may want to change?

Exercise 3:

- Access the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography by searching the NU library's databases for "ODNB." Search for your person by name.

- Take a minute to skim the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article for your person. Even though the *Six Degrees* graph was derived from this and other ODNB articles, who is missing from this graph? What do those people have in common?

- What's the difference between representing someone's biography *as prose* on the ODNB and representing it *as a network visualization* in *Six Degrees of Francis Bacon*?

Exercise 4:

- Search for the Shared Network of your person and William Shakespeare. Who did these two people know in common?

- On the your person--Shakespeare shared network, what groups are most of the people members of? What might this tell us about these two writers?

When you've completed all four exercises, write a one-paragraph reflection for Blackboard on your experience of investigating a person's biography through networks. Is this visualization tool illuminating? alienating? How does reducing a person's life to a network graph highlight certain attributes while hiding others?
