## Metadata Can Be Descriptive.

- Page count: 1424 pages

## Metadata Can Be Administrative.

It can help you manage a resource and tell you about how it was created.

*Broken Earth* Examples:

- Publisher: Orbit
- ISBN: 031652719X
- Ebook formats: Kindle, epub

## Metadata Can Be Structural.

It can help you understand the different parts of the dataset and their relationship.

For structured datasets, this is often column labels and their meanings.

*Broken Earth* Examples:

- Chapter titles
- Index
- Table of Contents

## Metadata has standards for interoperability.

[Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/) -- 13 features common to digital data

[DDI: Data Documentation Initiative](https://www.ddialliance.org/) -- social, behavioral, and economic sciences

[MARC: MAchine Readable Cataloging](https://www.loc.gov/marc/) -- libraries, books & media
