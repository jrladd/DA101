<h1>The Null Hypothesis and the Alternative Hypothesis</h1>

</section>
<section id="the-null-hypothesis-is-a-baseline-assumption-that-the-result-is-due-to-chance." class="slide level2">
<h2>The <strong>Null Hypothesis</strong> is a baseline assumption that the result is due to chance.</h2>
</section>
<section id="the-null-hypothesis-assumes-equality." class="slide level2">
<h2>The Null Hypothesis assumes <em>equality</em>.</h2>
<p>Consider two sample groups, A and B. (Such as the male and female groups of your alcohol use data.)</p>
<p>The null hypothesis would assume that the means of A and B are <em>equal</em>, that there is no difference between them, and that any observed difference we see is the result of randomness.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-a-hypothesis-test-we-try-to-prove-the-null-hypothesis-wrong." class="slide level2">
<h2>In a hypothesis test, we try to prove the null hypothesis <em>wrong</em>.</h2>
<p>We attempt to disprove the null hypothesis by showing that the observed data <strong>isn’t</strong> the result of randomness.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-alternative-hypothesis-accounts-for-all-possibilities-that-arent-the-null-hypothesis." class="slide level2">
<h2>The <strong>Alternative Hypothesis</strong> accounts for all possibilities that <em>aren’t</em> the Null Hypothesis.</h2>
<p>If there’s a null hypothesis, there has to be an alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis is that A and B are equal, then the alternative hypothesis would be that A and B are <em>not</em> equal (either smaller or bigger).</p>
</section>
<section id="the-alternative-hypothesis-can-be-one--or-two-tailed." class="slide level2">
<h2>The Alternative Hypothesis can be One- or Two-Tailed.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>One-tailed: We only care about a non-equal result in one direction, i.e. if A &gt; B but <strong>not</strong> if A &lt; B.</p></li>
<li><p>Two-tailed: We care about differences in both directions, i.e. A != B but could be larger or smaller.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Different research questions lead to different alternative hypotheses.</p>

<h2>What are the Null and Alternative Hypotheses?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Is the median house price in Granville larger than the median price in Newark?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the mean number of mountain lions per 100 km^2 equal in North and South America?</p></li>
<li><p>NHANES reports the average starting age of smoking is 19. Is this correct, or is the true mean lower than this?</p></li>

<h1>Interpreting a Hypothesis Test</h1>

</section>
<section id="lets-walk-through-an-example" class="slide level2">
<h2>Let’s walk through an example</h2>
<p>Say you have two web pages, Page A and Page B, and you’ve measured the amount of time internet users spend on each page. You’re trying to decide whether to replace Page A with Page B.</p>
</section>
<section id="first-look-at-the-difference" class="slide level2">
<h2>First look at the difference:</h2>
<p><img src="img/sessiontimes.png" style="max-height:60vh" /></p>
</section>
<section id="setting-up-the-test" class="slide level2">
<h2>Setting up the test</h2>
<p>The Null Hypothesis is that:</p>
<p><code>mean(A) = mean(B)</code></p>
<p>The Alternative Hypothesis is that:</p>
<p><code>mean(B) &gt; mean(A)</code> (one-tailed)</p>
</section>
<section id="lets-imagine-reshuffling-the-data." class="slide level2">
<h2>Let’s imagine reshuffling the data.</h2>
<p>We have two clear groups: the people who saw Page A and the ones who saw Page B. But we could reshuffle this data a thousand times in a thousand different configurations, where the session times are separated into equally sized but random groups.</p>
<p>In the end we’d have a <em>distribution</em> of how much the means differ among a thousand random groups.</p>
</section>
<section id="we-can-compare-our-observed-difference-to-that-distribution." class="slide level2">
<h2>We can compare our <strong>observed difference</strong> to that distribution.</h2>
<p><img src="img/resampling.png" style="max-height:55vh" /></p>
</section>
<section id="in-this-case-we-care-about-how-often-the-random-differences-were-greater-than-the-observed-difference." class="slide level2">
<h2>In this case, we care about how often the random differences were greater than the observed difference.</h2>
<p>I.e., how often the values were to the right of the dotted line.</p>
<p>In this case, that was about 12% percent of the time. That’s a lot! And that means that this observed difference isn’t all that unusual.</p>
</section></section>
<section>
<section id="statistical-significance-and-the-p-value" class="title-slide slide level1">
<h1>Statistical Significance and the P-value</h1>

</section>
<section id="we-could-keep-looking-at-graphs-like-these-but-thats-imprecise." class="slide level2">
<h2>We could keep looking at graphs like these, but that’s imprecise.</h2>
<p>Instead, we can measure the probability of obtaining results as unusual as the observed result.</p>
<p>This probability is called the p-value!</p>
</section>
<section id="the-p-values-formal-definition" class="slide level2">
<h2>The p-value’s formal definition:</h2>
<p>Given a chance model that embodies the null hypothesis, the p-value is the probability of obtaining results as unusual or extreme as the observed result.</p>
<p>In our example, our 12% was a p-value of .12!</p>
</section>
<section id="is-a-common-alpha-or-pre-determined-cutoff-for-significance." class="slide level2">
<h2>.05 is a common <em>alpha</em>, or pre-determined cutoff for significance.</h2>
<p>If the p-value is lower than .05 (5%), we can reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>If the p-value is higher than .05 (5%), we fail to reject the null hypothesis and our result could be random.</p>
<p>This is just a rule of thumb!</p>
</section>
<section id="t-tests-let-you-calculate-a-p-value-for-a-difference-in-means." class="slide level2">
<h2>T-Tests let you calculate a p-value for a difference in means.</h2>
<p>In our example of two groups in our data, we could test whether their difference in means is significant using a <strong>t-test</strong>.</p>
<p>A t-test estimates the random reshuffled distributions based on a series of assumptions about what that distribution should look like. It calculates a p-value based on that “t-distribution.”</p>
<p>Different statistical tests calculate p-values for other kinds of differences.</p>
</section>
<section id="all-other-things-being-equal" class="slide level2">
<h2>All other things being equal…</h2>
<ul>
<li>The observed difference increasing will decrease the p-value (more likely to find significance)</li>
<li>The sample size increasing will decrease the p-value (more likely to find significance)</li>
<li>The variability increasing will increase the p-value (less likely to find significance)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="dont-only-consider-the-p-value" class="slide level2">
<h2>Don’t <em>only</em> consider the p-value!</h2>
<p>Consider results that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statistically significant and useful</strong></li>
<li>Statistically significant and not useful</li>
<li>Statistically insignificant and useful</li>
<li>Marginally significant and useful (practically significant)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="error-in-hypothesis-testing" class="slide level2">
<h2>Error in Hypothesis Testing</h2>
<p><img data-src="img/errorht.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type I Error (alpha-error) is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.</p></li>
<li><p>Type II Error (beta-error) is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Misreading or overemphasizing the p-value can lead us to error!</p>
