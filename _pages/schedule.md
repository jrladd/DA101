## Course Materials

Most of our course materials will be PDFs (posted to the Files section of canvas), or links shared in the schedule above. For your own convenience, and to make our longer readings easier, you may consider purchasing the two books listed below. However, having physical copies of these is **not** a prerequisite for the class: if you can't get these books for any reason, simply let me know, and we'll work it out.

- Ben Jonson *The Staple of News* (ISBN 9780719059063)
- Emily St. John Mandel *Station Eleven* (ISBN 0804172447)
