## Class Schedule

**On Monday and Wednesday we'll cover new topics and skills, and on Fridays we'll discuss readings related to those topics. This schedule also includes the topics for the Labs, which will reinforce what we do in class.**

*I will add Lab links to Github Classroom assignments before each week's lab. You'll find a [guide to using Github Classroom here](/DA101/githubclassroom).*
