To make this syllabus, I consulted lots of courses from many instructors who graciously made their syllabi public and shared links on Twitter. I also want to thank the many people from whom I got advice and inspiration for this course, including Doug Knox, Steve Pentecost, Scott Weingart, Alison Langmead, Matt Lavin, Melanie Walsh, Wendy Wall, Joe Loewenstein, Meredith Kelling, and Anna Preus.
