On this page you'll find the main assignments for our course. Detailed descriptions of each assignment, especially the instructions and resources for the Labs, will be posted to the NoteBowl/ActiveClass page for our course. You will also use NoteBowl/ActiveClass to turn in assignments and receive feedback. You can find NoteBowl at: <https://notebowl.denison.edu>.

## Assignments

### Assignment Breakdown

Instead of a letter grade, you'll receive a number of points for each assignment out of a possible total. Sometimes these values are multiplied by ten to allow for easier grading, i.e. if something is worth 5 points, you might receive a grade out of 50. At the end of the semester, all the points you received will be added up to determine your final grade (see the grading scale below).

Assignment|Point Value
----|--
Quizzes|10
Code Glossary|10
Lab Work & Reports|50
Oral Presentation|5
Final Project|25

### Quizzes

You'll be given very short (5-10 minute) quizzes to test your knowledge and retention of topics from class and lab. These will typically be given every other week, at the start of Wednesday's class. *The lowest grade will be dropped.*

### Code Glossary

As we learn new R skills throughout the semester, you'll create and revise a glossary of key terms with examples. You will turn in updates to the glossary periodically, in place of a lab report for that week.

### Lab Work & Reports

In weekly labs you'll practice, apply, and extend the topics and skills you learn in class. Labs will include topics from different domains (e.g. biology, political science, sociology, entertainment, &c.). Some labs will be individual assignments, while others will require you to collaborate with a small group. Each lab will include a lab report.

Instructions and resources for each lab will be posted on NoteBowl/ActiveClass, where you'll also turn in your reports and other assignments.

**Due** by 11:59pm on the night before your next lab session. (So, Sunday nights for those of you with Monday lab and Tuesday nights for those of you with Wednesday lab.) You'll receive feedback from me typically by Thursday or Friday of that same week.

The point breakdown for labs is as follows:

Lab|Number of Weeks|Point Value
---|--|---
Biology/Ecology|2|10
Data Collection|1|5
Substance Use|2|10
Ethics|1|5
Political Polarization|2|10
AirBnB|1|5
Marvel Comics|1|5
**Total Lab Points**||**50**

### Oral Presentation

During the final week of class, you'll give a short presentation explaining the topic of your final projects and some of your main findings. This is distinct from the written report on your final project.

### Final Project

The final project will be a culmination of the skills you have learned in the weeks prior, and will offer more flexibility in your design, data choices, and approach, while demonstrating mastery of the breadth of skills discussed in the course. Potential topics will be discussed and approved with the instructor. Final reports will discuss the data, analytical approach, and a visual presentation of the results.

You'll submit the project in several stages, and more detail on those deadlines will be posted to NoteBowl/ActiveClass.

## Grading Scale

Letter Grade|Point Total
---|---
A|90-100
B|80-89
C|70-79
D|60-69
F|<60

Plus and minus grades will be given at my discretion, but will generally correspond to the high and low ends of the above ranges.
